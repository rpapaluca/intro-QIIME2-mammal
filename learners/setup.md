### Mac: 
No additional software needs to be installed for this workshop. You will use the Terminal app. Files can be transferred between your local computer and the remote Nectar Instance using scp. If you are a novice on the command line, software for transferring files such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) can be used.

### Windows:
1. A terminal emulator such as [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) (free and open-source) will need to be downloaded.
2. Software for file transfers between a local computer and remote server such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) is required.

## Required Data
No additional data needs to be downloaded for this workshop - it is all located on the Nectar Instance. FASTQs are located in the directory raw_data and a metadata (echidna_metadata.tsv) file has also been provided.

If you wish to analyse the data independently at a later stage, [it can be downloaded from here](https://zenodo.org/records/10158305). This link contains both the FASTQs and associated metadata file.

If you are running this tutorial independently, you can also access the [classifier that has been trained specifically for this data from here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s42p5fif7szzm38swcu0m/silva_138_16s_515-806_classifier.qza?rlkey=ss983qau9rwgztis2gfulhjcz&e=1&dl=0).
